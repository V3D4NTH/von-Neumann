John von-Neumann was a founding figure in computing. He made significant contributions to the fields of computing hardware design, theoretical computer science, and the philosophy of computer science. During his time as a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee , he consulted for the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory on the revolutionary ENIAC and EDVAC projects. The inputs he picked up from his time there served as a precursor to the invention of the Von-Neumann Architecture. 

This project aims to create an 8-bit micro computer that emulates the Von-Neumann architecture.
